# 📊 Diabetes Hospital Readmission Dashboard

This project visualizes and analyzes diabetic patient hospital readmission data using Tableau. It helps uncover patterns in readmission rates based on age, gender, race, diagnosis, hospital stay duration, and medication levels.

## 🔍 Overview
- Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard using real-world healthcare data (100K+ patient records).
- Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual analysis to explore risk factors contributing to hospital readmissions.
- Visualized trends across demographics and clinical attributes.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Tableau
- Microsoft Excel (CSV conversion)
- Python (optional preprocessing)
- Kaggle Dataset: [Diabetes Hospital Readmission](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes)

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Readmission Rate by Age Group
- Readmission Rate by Gender and Race
- Hospital Stay Duration vs Readmission (Box Plot)
- Top Diagnoses with High Readmission Rates
- Interactive filters by gender, race, diagnosis, and age
